                <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956), popularly known as Babasaheb Ambedkar, was an Indian jurist, economist, politician and social reformer who inspired
                    the Dalit Buddhist movement and campaigned against social discrimination towards the untouchables (Dalits), while also supporting the rights of women and labour.</li>
                <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;He was independent India's first law and justice minister, the architect of the Constitution of India, and a founding father of the Republic of India. In India and elsewhere,
                    he was often called Babasaheb, meaning "respected father" in Marathi and Hindi.</li>
                <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a prolific student earning doctorates in economics from both Columbia University and the London School of Economics and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research
                    in law, economics, and political science.
                </li>
                <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer.</li>
                <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals, advocating political
                    rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism initiating mass conversions of Dalits.</li>
                <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar.</li>
                <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture.</li>

                    <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now Dr. Ambedkar Nagar) in the Central Provinces (now in Madhya Pradesh). He was the 14th
                        and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal and Bhimabai Sakpal.</li>
                    <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a poor low Mahar (dalit) caste, who
                        were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.
                    </li>
                    <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the British East India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment.</li>
                    <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside
                        the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for
                        the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water". He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he
                        had to take home with him.</li>
                    <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to Satara two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal
                        aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons – Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao – and two daughters – Manjula and Tulasa – of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations
                        and went to high school. His original surname was Sakpal but his father registered his name as Ambadawekar in school, meaning he comes from his native village of Ambadawe in Ratnagiri district.</li>
                    <li><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;His Devrukhe Brahmin teacher, Krishna Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from "Ambadawekar" to his own surname "Ambedkar" in school records.</li>
